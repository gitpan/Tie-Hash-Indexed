1. DESCRIPTION
--------------

Tie::Hash::Indexed is very similar to Tie::IxHash. However,
it is written completely in XS and usually about twice as
fast as Tie::IxHash. It's quite a lot faster when it comes
to clearing or deleting entries from large hashes.
Currently, only the plain tying mechanism is supported.

---------------
2. INSTALLATION
---------------

Installation of the Tie::Hash::Indexed module follows the standard
Perl Way and should not be harder than:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Note that you may need to become superuser to 'make install'.

If you're building the module under Windows, you may need to use a
different make program, such as 'nmake', instead of 'make'.
