1. DESCRIPTION
--------------

Tie::Hash::Indexed is very similar to Tie::IxHash. However,
it is written completely in XS and usually about twice as
fast as Tie::IxHash. It's quite a lot faster when it comes
to clearing or deleting entries from large hashes.
Currently, only the plain tying mechanism is supported.

---------------
2. INSTALLATION
---------------

Installation of the Tie::Hash::Indexed module follows the standard
Perl Way and should not be harder than:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

Note that you may need to become superuser to 'make install'.

If you're building the module under Windows, you may need to use a
different make program, such as 'nmake', instead of 'make'.

-----------
3. FEATURES
-----------

You can enable or disable certain features at compile time by adding
options to the Makefile.PL call. However, you can safely leave them
at their default.

Currently, the only available feature is 'debug' to build the module
with debugging support. If your perl binary was already built with
debugging support, the 'debug' feature is enabled by default.

You can enable or disable features explicitly by adding the arguments

  enable-feature
  disable-feature

to the Makefile.PL call. To explicitly build the module with debugging
enabled, you would say:

  perl Makefile.PL enable-debug

This will still allow you to pass other 'standard' arguments to
Makefile.PL, like

  perl Makefile.PL enable-debug OPTIMIZE=-O3
